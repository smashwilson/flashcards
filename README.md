# Flashcards

Electron app to cycle through an array as you click, so I can practice sight words and math problems with my daughter. Code is haphazard because I hacked this together while the kids were doing YouTube yoga :stuck_out_tongue:

Slide content is read from a JSON file containing an array of strings called `slides.json`:

```json
["1", "2", "3", "4", "5"]
```

Start the flashcards with `npm start`.
